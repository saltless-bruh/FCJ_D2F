he# AI Agent Instructions for Session Manager Project

## Project Overview
This is a Hugo-based documentation project for managing and tracking internship sessions, focused on an IoT Security Monitoring & Alert System project. The site uses the Hugo Learn theme with bilingual support (English/Vietnamese).

## Key Project Structures

### Content Organization
- Content is organized in numbered sections under `/content/`:
  - `1-Worklog/` - Daily/weekly activity logs
  - `2-Proposal/` - Project proposals and plans
  - `3-Translated Blogs/` - Technical blog translations
  - Other sections for events, workshops, and assessments

### Bilingual Support
- Each content section has dual language files:
  - `_index.md` - English version
  - `_index.vi.md` - Vietnamese version
- Translations should maintain technical accuracy while being culturally appropriate

### Theme Customization
- Project uses a customized Hugo Learn theme
- Custom styling in `/static/css/`:
  - `theme-mine.css` - Main theme customization
  - `theme-workshop.css` - Workshop-specific styling

## Development Workflows

### Local Development
```bash
hugo serve  # Start local development server
hugo  # Build static site to /public
```

### Content Guidelines
1. All content files must include Hugo frontmatter with:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Section Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   weight: N
   chapter: false
   pre: " <b> N. </b> "
   ---
   ```

2. Technical content should:
   - Include code samples when relevant
   - Use proper heading hierarchy
   - Reference related AWS services accurately
   - Include diagrams for complex concepts

## Critical Knowledge

### Project Scope
- IoT Security Monitoring System documentation
- Focus on AWS cloud services integration
- Hardware-software integration documentation
- Security and PKI infrastructure details

### Cross-references
- Link related content using Hugo relative links
- Reference AWS services consistently
- Maintain hierarchical navigation structure

### Automation
- Content changes automatically rebuild via Hugo
- Navigation structure autogenerated from frontmatter
- Multilingual support handled through Hugo's i18n

## Common Operations
1. Adding new content:
   ```bash
   hugo new section-name/_index.md
   hugo new section-name/_index.vi.md
   ```
2. Theme updates should be made in custom CSS files
3. Assets (images, PDFs) go in `/static/images/`
