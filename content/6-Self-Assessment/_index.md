#### Install and Configure AWS CLI and Session Manager Plugin
  
To perform this hands-on, make sure your workstation has [AWS CLI]() and [Session Manager Plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session) installed -manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)

More hands-on tutorials on installing and configuring the AWS CLI can be found [here](https://000011.awsstudygroup.com/).

{{%notice tip%}}
With Windows, when extracting the **Session Manager Plugin** installation folder, run the **install.bat** file with Administrator permission to perform the installation.

#### Implement Portforwarding

1. Run the command below in **Command Prompt** on your machine to configure **Port Forwarding**.

``` bash
   aws ssm start-session --target (your ID windows instance) --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession --parameters portNumber="3389",localPortNumber="9999" --region (your region)
```

{{%notice tip%}}

**Windows Private Instance** **Instance ID** information can be found when you view the EC2 Windows Private Instance server details.

- Example command:

``` powershell
C:\Windows\system32>aws ssm start-session --target i-06343d7377486760c --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession --parameters portNumber="3389",localPortNumber="9999" --region ap-southeast-1
```

{{%notice warning%}}

If your command gives an error like below: \
SessionManagerPlugin is not found. Please refer to SessionManager Documentation here: <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/systems-manager/session-manager-plugin-not-found\>
Prove that you have not successfully installed the Session Manager Plugin. You may need to relaunch **Command Prompt** after installing **Session Manager Plugin**.

2. Connect to the **Private Windows Instance** you created using the **Remote Desktop** tool on your workstation.
   - In the Computer section: enter **localhost:9999**.

3. Return to the administration interface of the System Manager - Session Manager service.
   - Click tab **Session history**.
   - We will see session logs with Document name **AWS-StartPortForwardingSession**.

Congratulations on completing the lab on how to use Session Manager to connect and store session logs in S3 bucket. Remember to perform resource cleanup to avoid unintended costs.
