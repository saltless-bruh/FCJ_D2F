### WORKLOG

⚠️ **Note**: This worklog documents my actual internship experience. All information reflects real work completed during the program.

On this page, you will find a comprehensive overview of my internship worklog. I completed the AWS First Cloud Journey internship program over a 13-week period (September 8 to December 4, 2025), during which I developed an IoT Security Infrastructure Platform using various AWS services.

Throughout the internship, I focused on building a production-grade security system with PKI certificate management, threat detection, automated incident response, and compliance reporting capabilities. I also attended multiple AWS events, completed hands-on lab training, and contributed technical blog translations to the FCJ community.
